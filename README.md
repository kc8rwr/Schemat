# Schemat
An old DOS QuickBasic schematic design editor updated for QB64.

What is it good for?

-Probably nothing at all.
-Maybe someone might use it to make really quick and simple schematic diagrams of small circuits for educational purposes.
-Maybe someone might place this on an old retro DOS computer for display. (If it ever works in DOS again).
-But most likely it isn't good for anything.

Why am I doing this?

I started this program when I was a teenager in high school. At the time I used to see ads for Circuit Maker and Electronics Workbench, two schematic capture and simulation programs that were popular at the time in electronics magazines. I did not have the money for this nor a computer capable of running them. I was still using MS-DOS.

I wanted to write a similar application myself but geared towards older PCs like my own. I thought I could do this in QuickBasic. I had not yet heard of Open Source but shareware was common then. I thought I was going to sell it for a low price and make EDA software available to everyone.

Obviously it never progressed that far but I did manage to build a simple little schematic capture program with a full version and a shareware version which my computer teacher uploaded to a BBS for me. I never heard from anyone who downloaded it.

Over the years the floppy with my code was lost or destroyed. I still had paper printouts.  I ran across these while cleaning and decided it was time to finally do something about it.  I typed it all back in using QB64 and made some modifications so that it would run.

Now I am putting it on GitHub so it doesn't get lost again. If anyone wants to extend this for their own purposes (although I doubt it) it is here. I only ask that any improvements be shared as well.
